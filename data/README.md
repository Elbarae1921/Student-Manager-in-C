# Data

the data is stored in the data.txt file.

it's written in binary so if you open it in a text editor you'll only see gibberish.

i made it a txt file just to see what happens, the data in it is unaccessible outside the program.

(a new txt file called tempdata.txt is created when deleting a student's data, you can't notice that cause it's deleted as soon as the process ends).

In case of file i/o problems, delete data.txt and create another file (make sure it's empty).
