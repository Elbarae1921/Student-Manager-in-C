# Data

data is stored in the data.txt

The data is not understandable because it's written in binary.

when opening the data.txt file with notepad all you will see is the names and some unknown weird symbols, so use notepad++ or better text editor.

secret : another txt file named tempdata.txt is created when deleting a student's data but you can't notice that because the file gets deleted immediatly
