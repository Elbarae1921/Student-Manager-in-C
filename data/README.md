# Data

the data is stored in the data.txt file

it's written in binary so if you open it in a text editor all you'll see names and "null"s

i made it a txt file just to see what happens, the data in it is unaccessible outside the program

secret : a new txt file called tempdata.txt is created when deleting a student's data, you can't notice that cause it's deleted as soon as the process ends.
