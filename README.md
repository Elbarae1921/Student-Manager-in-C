# Student-Manager-in-C
a C program that manages students using structures and file i/o

This program is a school project i made using C-lang as a practice of structures and file i/o.

The program uses a student structure (ID, first name, second name, score) and saves the data in a binary file data.txt
(i know it's a txt file i'm sorry i just wanted to see what happens there)

That's all.
